Description:
Blacklight is a top down atmospheric survival horror with light and vision based combat mechanics.
You play as Richard Johnson, a heroic scavenger who is exploring an abandoned military facility. Equipped with only his trusty pistol and a pair of night vision goggles, Richard must make good use of the few remaining infrared lights in the facility and remain wary of his surroundings as he traverses the facility and discovers why it was abandoned.

Instructions:
Are available in both the main menu and the pause menu as well as here; WASD to move, use the mouse to aim and look, left click to shoot, right click when close to a door to open/close it , hold right click and use WASD to drag a crate with you, and use P or esc to pause when in game.

Known bugs:
When the cursor hovers over the center of the player while moving the player character has a bit of a fit, which can affect the players aim if for whatever reason they tried to shoot themselves. 
Sometimes the Ghosts can drag the doors off the wall and take it with them for a short distance, although it will snap back to its proper position after a short time.
Sometimes when the game reloads a checkpoint it wipes the players current ammunition, this isn't always a problem as most checkpoints have unlimited ammo boxes, but shouldn't be happening.
